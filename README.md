# Angry-Birds


I have applied important Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as: 

• Encapsulation: I made the fields of the Red Bird class private and added getter and setter methods to control access to these fields. 
• Abstraction: I created an abstract Bird class to represent the shared behavior of all birds, and extended it with specific bird classes like BlueBird ,RedBird and YellowBird.
This allows for code reuse and ensures that changes to shared behavior can be made in a centralized location. 

• Inheritance: I used inheritance to extend the abstract Bird class with specific bird classes like BlueBird , RedBird and YellowBird. This promotes code reuse and allows for specialized behavior for each specific bird. 

• Polymorphism: I used polymorphism to create a Game class that can contain any type of bird, and allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior at runtime. This also promotes code reuse and makes the code more concise and maintainable.
